Here, in a confidential letter written from Osborne the following day, Disraeli describes to his private secretary, Montagu Corry, his first audience with Queen Victoria as her Premier. He arrived at 7p.m.; about half an hour afterwards the door opened, '& the Queen came in radiant with smiles, holding out her hand, saying \"You must kiss hands...\"' which he did 'most heartily' falling on his knee 'saying [that] I kissed her hand \"in faith & loving loyalty\"'. They talked so long he hardly had time to dress for dinner, dining almost 'quite alone' with Princess Louise and the Duchess of Athlone. This rapport would be enhanced by his lively written reports. Corry, later Lord Rowton (1838-1903), was another of those aristocratic, agreeable young men (his maternal grandfather was the 6th Lord Shaftsbury) with whom Disraeli surrounded himself. He was recruited by Disraeli to be his Private Secretary in 1866. Queen Victoria would later remark that Corry had devoted himself to Disraeli 'as few sons ever do'. In his last novel, Endymion, Disraeli would describe the bond between a minister and his secretary as among the finest that exist outside 'the married state'." .

The early part of the journey from London to Aix is recorded here. Most of the entries are in pencil and too faint to read with ease, but this description of an attempt to visit Ruben's house in Antwerp on 2 August 1824 gives some indication of Disraeli's enthusiasm for arhitecture - especially churches - paintings, food and landscape, and of his observations on history and local customs. Disraeli didn't keep a diary on the journey's second leg but he did decide to become a writer - and he drew on his experiences in his first novel, Vivian Grey." .

To maximise impact the draft was copied out by Sara Austen to conceal its authorship. Sara, considerably older than Disraeli, was married to his neighbour the lawyer Benjamin Austen, for whom Disraeli had worked. Both Austens were his patrons, she emotionally, he financially. Here she refers to the Star reviewer's comparisons with similar novels like Mathilda and Tremaine, set in 'fashionable' aristocratic society and aimed at middle class readers; the author was a 'lively and accomplished writer' and his 'ingenuity' praised. By July the enthusiasm among high society and reviewers turned to scorn when it was discovered that the satire had been by a youthful onlooker, not an insider." .

When this younger son of the 13th Earl of Derby went missing on arrival in London some of the Stanley family suspected Disraeli of introducing him to a gambling den, an unfortunate development which coloured years of his working relationship with Lord Stanley, the future 14th Earl of Derby, and his predecessor as Conservative Prime Minister." .

Sir Francis's property included Basildon Park in Berkshire (now a National Trust property), a setting for Henrietta Temple, the novel inspired by the affair and the pressing need to settle debts. Henrietta was aristocratic and sensuous and, as the references to 'A mother's kiss' (and 'your faithful and fond love') indicate, capable of meeting Disraeli's complex emotional needs. Their relationship was aided by Sir Francis's frequent absences abroad and complicated in the summer of 1834 by Henrietta introducing Disraeli to his future mentor, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst (1772-1863) with whom she later became involved. But it would be her affair with Disraeli's friend, the painter Daniel Maclise, which ended their relationship in December 1836 and subsequently threatened Disraeli's future." .

Disinclined to attend a proposed public meeting in Birmingham - 'at Christmas time one ought to be at home, and really we have had enough of public meetings for one winter' - he reports in this October 1844 letter (fol. 10v) on the response of the gentry to their movement. Henry Lyster had criticised Disraeli's speech at Shrewsbury (Disraeli's constituency, 1841-7) without hearing it. Manners, with his interest in factory reform and allotments, moves on to compare English and Irish peasants and their holdings and the views of Sir Edwin Chadwick (1800-90), the great sanitary reformer." .

Disraeli's use of electoral reform to disadvantage the Liberals had been compared to another opportunist David (later 1st Earl), Lord George (1863-1945) [Roy Jenkins, Gladstone (London, 1995), p. 268. Jenkins quoting Blake quoting Beaverbrook on Lloyd George]. More recently his behaviour in 1867 had been likened to a 'basketful of eels' [Ibid., p. 270].
