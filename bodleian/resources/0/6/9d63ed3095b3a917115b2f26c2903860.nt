This publication, designed to keep the League's supporters informed on the latest developments, describes a week-long national free-trade bazaar held in London in 1845. The celebration of manufactured goods, the support for free trade and the shift in economic power pointed to the future, but the repeal of the Corn Laws would shatter the unity of the Tories under Peel." .

His other main publication was the five-volume Commentaries on the life and reign of Charles I (1828-30), a topic well-suited to his romantic conservatism. For this study he was awarded a DCL by the University of Oxford in 1832. In addition to these major works Isaac was also the author of several now-forgotten novels and poems." .

The early part of the journey from London to Aix is recorded here. Most of the entries are in pencil and too faint to read with ease, but this description of an attempt to visit Ruben's house in Antwerp on 2 August 1824 gives some indication of Disraeli's enthusiasm for arhitecture - especially churches - paintings, food and landscape, and of his observations on history and local customs. Disraeli didn't keep a diary on the journey's second leg but he did decide to become a writer - and he drew on his experiences in his first novel, Vivian Grey." .

To maximise impact the draft was copied out by Sara Austen to conceal its authorship. Sara, considerably older than Disraeli, was married to his neighbour the lawyer Benjamin Austen, for whom Disraeli had worked. Both Austens were his patrons, she emotionally, he financially. Here she refers to the Star reviewer's comparisons with similar novels like Mathilda and Tremaine, set in 'fashionable' aristocratic society and aimed at middle class readers; the author was a 'lively and accomplished writer' and his 'ingenuity' praised. By July the enthusiasm among high society and reviewers turned to scorn when it was discovered that the satire had been by a youthful onlooker, not an insider." .

Here he notes that his fellow passenger, Henry Stanley, had received a letter in Cadiz that the bill to extend the franchise would be lost - an outcome they could 'barely credit'. When this younger son of the 13th Earl of Derby went missing on arrival in London some of the Stanley family suspected Disraeli of introducing him to a gambling den, an unfortunate development which coloured years of his working relationship with Lord Stanley, the future 14th Earl of Derby, and his predecessor as Conservative Prime Minister." .

Disraeli greatly valued Bulwer's intellectually stimulating friendship. The satirical Xion in Heaven, published in Bulwer's New monthly magazine in December 1832 and February 1833, is considered one of Disraeli's most original works." .

Sir Francis's property included Basildon Park in Berkshire (now a National Trust property), a setting for Henrietta Temple, the novel inspired by the affair and the pressing need to settle debts. Henrietta was aristocratic and sensuous and, as the references to 'A mother's kiss' (and 'your faithful and fond love') indicate, capable of meeting Disraeli's complex emotional needs. Their relationship was aided by Sir Francis's frequent absences abroad and complicated in the summer of 1834 by Henrietta introducing Disraeli to his future mentor, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst (1772-1863) with whom she later became involved. But it would be her affair with Disraeli's friend, the painter Daniel Maclise, which ended their relationship in December 1836 and subsequently threatened Disraeli's future." .

Smythe's best friend at Cambridge, he was the model for Lord Henry Sidney in Coningsby. Disinclined to attend a proposed public meeting in Birmingham - 'at Christmas time one ought to be at home, and really we have had enough of public meetings for one winter' - he reports in this October 1844 letter (fol. 10v) on the response of the gentry to their movement. Henry Lyster had criticised Disraeli's speech at Shrewsbury (Disraeli's constituency, 1841-7) without hearing it. Manners, with his interest in factory reform and allotments, moves on to compare English and Irish peasants and their holdings and the views of Sir Edwin Chadwick (1800-90), the great sanitary reformer." .
