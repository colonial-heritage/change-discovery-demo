_:df_34881_11 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#value> "After the publication of the first part of Vivian Grey Disraeli's health buckled under the strain of his frenetic life style, failures and mounting debts. Travelling to Italy with the Austens between August and October brought some respite but most of 1827 was lost to illness and depression, though he managed to complete the second part of his novel and registar as a pupil barrister. Popanilla appeared in 1828 but the only really positive development during this dark phase was the D'Israeli family settling permanently in Buckinghamshire, at Bradenham Manor, leaving London because of Mrs D'Israeli's poor health. It was to Bradenham that Disraeli retreated in December 1829. The sixteenth-century house, remodelled in the eighteenth, is now National Trust offices." .

_:df_34881_13 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#value> "In the spring of 1830 Disraeli's health had improved sufficiently for him to work on two books, The Young Duke and Alroy, and to resume his raffish social life. It was now that he became close friends with the writer and future Colonial Secretary Edward Bulwer Lytton, later Lord Lytton (1803-73). He also became involved with Clara Bolton at this time, his own doctor's wife, but he was far from fully restored and there were worrying reminders of Isaac's own breakdown at around this age. Travelling was again the antidote - as well as an escape from pressing creditors (his debts amounted to Ãº4,500). The consequences of his visit with Meredith to Spain and the Middle East (funded by money for The Young Duke and the Austen advance) would reach far beyond his return in October 1831, for they were crucial in shaping Disraeli's perceptions of himself, his racial origins and the wider world." .

His other main publication was the five-volume Commentaries on the life and reign of Charles I (1828-30), a topic well-suited to his romantic conservatism. For this study he was awarded a DCL by the University of Oxford in 1832. In addition to these major works Isaac was also the author of several now-forgotten novels and poems." .

The early part of the journey from London to Aix is recorded here. Most of the entries are in pencil and too faint to read with ease, but this description of an attempt to visit Ruben's house in Antwerp on 2 August 1824 gives some indication of Disraeli's enthusiasm for arhitecture - especially churches - paintings, food and landscape, and of his observations on history and local customs. Disraeli didn't keep a diary on the journey's second leg but he did decide to become a writer - and he drew on his experiences in his first novel, Vivian Grey." .

To maximise impact the draft was copied out by Sara Austen to conceal its authorship. Sara, considerably older than Disraeli, was married to his neighbour the lawyer Benjamin Austen, for whom Disraeli had worked. Both Austens were his patrons, she emotionally, he financially. Here she refers to the Star reviewer's comparisons with similar novels like Mathilda and Tremaine, set in 'fashionable' aristocratic society and aimed at middle class readers; the author was a 'lively and accomplished writer' and his 'ingenuity' praised. By July the enthusiasm among high society and reviewers turned to scorn when it was discovered that the satire had been by a youthful onlooker, not an insider." .
